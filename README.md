## In this project I have:

* Prepared and cleanead the data.

* Generated summary statistics.

* Created bar charts and pie charts.

* Calculated quartiles, found outliers, and created a box plot.

* Created a line plot and a scatter plot.

* Calculated correlation and regression. 


## Analysis

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

In the analysis of tumour volume progression over time in mice treated with Capomulin, it has been observed that in the vast majority of cases the tumour volume tends to decrease.

When analysing the evolution of a randomly selected mouse, it was observed that when treated with Capomulin, at the end of the treatment the tumour volume decreased by 30%.

Also for the Capomulin regimen, a positive correlation between the average tumor volume and the mouse weight has been found, i.e. the heavier the mouse, the more likely it is that the tumour volume will be larger.

The distribution of data according to the sex of the mice is equal, as the mice analysed were 50.4% male and 49.6% female.
